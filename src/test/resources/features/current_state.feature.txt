Feature: Stationary Devices with their current state
	As a guest
	I want to know basic information about the stationary devices in the learning space
	So that I can decide whether I want to go to there

Background:
	Given I am on the “CurrentState” page

Examples: States
	| state |
	| free |
	| occupied |

Scenario: display <state> computers
	Given one or more “computer” is currently “<state>”
	Then the currently “<state>” computers are displayed as “<state>”
	And the current operating system on the computer is displayed

Scenario: display <state> printers
	Given one or more “printer” is currently “<state>”
	Then the currently “<state>” printers are displayed as “<state>”
	And the remaining number of orders is displayed

Scenario: display out of order devices
	Given one or more “device” is currently “out of order”
	Then the currently “out of order” devices are displayed as “out of order”

Scenario: display devices with no information
	Given one or more “device” is currently “unknown”
	Then the currently “unknown” devices are displayed as “unknown”
	And I get a hint to update the information

Scenario: display devices with old information
	Given the data from the learning space is too old
	Then I get a hint to update the information
	And the last known state of the learning room with a time stamp is displayed
